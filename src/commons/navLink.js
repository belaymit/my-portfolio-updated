    `Belay is exactly the sort of developer any company would love.
     He has brilliant communication skills. 
    I worked alongside him while building 2 
    different projects and he was always positive and open to learning from others.
     He was great at remote teamwork, and pair programming and has a keen eye for design.
      He is also super friendly and respectful so when we worked together,
       I felt like we'd known each other for years. I can't recommend him enough!`,

    `I had the pleasure of studying alongside Belay in several courses at Microverse,
     an online tech code academy, and I must say that he is one of the most professional
      and knowledgeable developers I have met. 
      Belay has a strong understanding of various coding languages such as Ruby, 
      React, JavaScript, CSS, and HTML. His dedication to his work is evident 
      through his consistent hard work and willingness to help his classmates
       in any way he can. I am impressed with his ability to find solutions 
       to complex problems quickly and efficiently. Belay is an asset to
        any team and I highly recommend him to any employer looking for a 
        dedicated, professional, and skilled developer.`,

    `Belay was my coding partner during the Microverse Program, and his skills and knowledge were unparalleled. Along with that, he brought energy and dependability that made him crucial to our project.
    He showed broad knowledge in Jest and save our team time, by finding the simplest solution, he was never late for a meeting, and he was always ready to solve any issue that will come our way, 
    I wish him the best in all he does and I know that any position he wishes to undertake he will doubtlessly be a star in it`,
